# MMF Monitor

Provides the ability to fetch the items
in the MMF vault.

### For developers

Use `firebase serve --only functions` to run locally.

Use `firebase deploy --only functions:<FUNCTION_NAME>` to deploy.

Deploy functions one at a time for safety.

When deploying, if asked about deleting functions
not found in local source code. Always say **NO**.
